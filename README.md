# Churn Prediction & Retention Platform

## Overview
This project is an API-first but GUI visualized churn prediction and marketing retention platform designed to help marketing and product teams identify at-risk users, understand churn drivers, and trigger targeted retention actions.

## Problem Statement
Marketing teams often lack actionable insights on which users are likely to churn and why, resulting in ineffective blanket campaigns and revenue loss.

## Solution
This platform predicts churn risk, explains the drivers behind churn, and recommends targeted retention actions via documented APIs. A Streamlit UI consumes these APIs for visualization and demo purposes.

## Target Users
- Marketing & Growth Teams
- CRM Systems
- Product Managers

## Key Features (Planned)
- Churn prediction (real-time and batch)
- Explainable churn drivers
- Retention action recommendations
- API-first architecture (FastAPI)
- Streamlit UI as API consumer
